Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations.

Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services. I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).

Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical.

We were issued a ‚Äústandby‚Ä?ticket without any seats.

If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late.

So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn‚Äôt have flights to Z√ºrich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Z√ºrich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn‚Äôt show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link.

We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn‚Äôt go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can‚Äôt specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it‚Äôs customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let‚Äôs face it, a lot of people are like us, we don‚Äôt travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Naples via Dublin,May-23,3,4,4,1,1,1,3,no,satisfied,Loyal Customer,57,Personal Travel,Eco,374,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,2,2,0,2,1,2,2,0,0

I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying.

Then we were freezing. After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told.

Buy-on-board products didn't look good quality from looking online, felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers. My biggest issue though is Aer Lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities, so they're not anywhere near cheap - yet it feels like a low-cost basic experience. I think even a complimentary snack and some water is the least the should offer as their sister airline BA now do in short-haul economy given the premium charge. I would fly with them again only if they were the only better option as on this route.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Cork,Feb-23,4,2,1,3,,,3,no,satisfied,Loyal Customer,58,Personal Travel,Eco,622,0,3,0,4,3,1,4,1,1,0,1,3,1,3,0,0

Aer Lingus can no longer provide this service - they booked us onto a British Airways flight but on the 'cheap' seats - with hand baggage only, to the value of approximately GBP150 pounds for all 4 of us. There were checked baggage options available as I asked BA and it still would have only cost 215 pounds compared to the 412 I paid Aer Lingus. Now Aer Lingus reuse to refund me the extra legroom and checked baggage fees. I have to pay again to BA to have 25kg checked baggage x 4 and extra legroom seats are now not available. They take your money, can't provide a service, refuse a reasonable request for refunds, book you on a third of the price seats/flight and pocket my change. Their terms and conditions are the seats/tickets are non refundable - I understand this however my seats / tickets with Aer Lingus are non existent so how do these rubbish non refundable terms and conditions apply to a non existent service? As you can imagine - they can't or WON'T answer that. Their email to me said an alternative flight or refund - I requested the refund and of course was ignored.

Be aware: you can do nothing online, including book or change seats and must call Customer Service for everything. They do not respond to emails, customer service is outsourced to overseas Indian or Eastern European countries where some do not speak English well enough to answer your query. They always say you have to email but you never receive a response (this after 24 emails over 3 mths and no responses). We flew business and they ran out of food. They offered economy meals. Flight attendants clearly did not like their jobs. The food (when you did manage to get any) was horrible and it was next to impossible to get a second drink, even water. Finally, we arrived in SFO to hear my husband's name called - they put my bag on the flight from Dublin but not his. We were leaving and checked through from Paris. They promised it would arrive next day, next flight. 10 days later it is still listed as tracking and in Dublin. We phoned several times to be told it was still in Dublin as far as they could see. We went several times to the airport and checked Lost Luggage -also finally went a 3rd day to see the same flight coming in and found a helpful man on security who phoned around. He left to go to an 'office' and came out with our bag. Fully tagged. It is still listed as 'being tracked'. We have contacted Aer Lingus to advise this but still listed as being in Dublin. .
