AB Aviation,9,"""pretty decent airline""",11th November 2019,TRUE,"  Moroni to Moheli. Turned out to be a pretty decent airline. Online booking worked well, checkin and boarding was fine and the plane looked well maintained. Its a very short flight - just 20 minutes or so so i didn't expect much but they still managed to hand our a bottle of water and some biscuits which i though was very nice. Both flights on time.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moroni to Moheli,Nov-19,4,5,4,4,,,3,yes
AB Aviation,1,"""Not a good airline""",25th June 2019,TRUE," Moroni to Anjouan. It is a very small airline. My ticket advised me to turn up at 0800hrs which I did. There was confusion at this small airport. I was then directed to the office of AB Aviation which was still closed. It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems. Not a good airline but it is the only one for Comoros.",E120,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moroni to Anjouan,Jun-19,2,2,1,1,,,2,no
AB Aviation,1,"""flight was fortunately short""",25th June 2019,TRUE,"  Anjouan to Dzaoudzi. A very small airline and the only airline based in Comoros. Check-in was disorganised because of locals with big packages and disinterested staff. The flight was fortunately short (30 mins). Took off on time and landed on time. With a short flight like there was of course no in-flight entertainment nor cabin service except for biscuits and a bottle of water, which was quite nice!",Embraer E120 ,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Anjouan to Dzaoudzi,Jun-19,2,1,1,1,,,2,no
Adria Airways,1,"""I will never fly again with Adria""",28th September 2019,FALSE,"  Please do a favor yourself and do not fly with Adria. On the route from Munich to Pristina in July 2019 they lost my luggage and for 10 days in a row, despite numerous phone calls they were not able to locate it. 11 days later the luggage arrived at the destination completely ruined. Applying for compensation, they ignored my request. Foolishly again, I booked another flight with them (345 euros) Frankfurt - Pristina in September 2019. They cancelled the flight with no reason 24 hours before the departure. Desperate phone calls to customer service to get anything (rerouting, compensation, etc) were not responded. I will never fly again with Adria. What a disgrace! Shame on you Adria for constantly deceiving your customers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Pristina,Sep-19,1,1,,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""it ruined our last days of holidays""",24th September 2019,TRUE," Do not book a flight with this airline! My friend and I should have returned from Sofia to Amsterdam on September 22 and 3 days before, they sent us an SMS informing the flight was cancelled. For 3 straight days we tried to reach the airline and the web agent (e-dreams) and we did not get a solution. Finally, 18 hours before our cancelled flight time, and after 35 minutes on a call (waiting), the airline was able to get us on a flight with Lufthansa. Do not book Adria Airways, it is unreliable and in our case, it ruined our last days of holidays since we needed to be on the phones all day.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sofia to Amsterdam via Ljubljana,Sep-19,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""Had very bad experience""",17th September 2019,TRUE,  Had very bad experience with rerouted and cancelled flights last weekend with Adria airways. Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost. Do not book flights with Adria airways. I heard that their financial situation is very very bad.,CR 900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sarajevo to Ljubljana,Sep-19,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""worse than the budget airlines""",6th September 2019,FALSE,"  Ljubljana to Z¨¹rich. Firstly, Ljubljana airport is terrible. Badly trained staff, unfriendly. Toilets are very dirty. Flight 2 hours delayed without any information. There is no Information desk so questions aren¡®t possible. Never again will use this airline. Its even worse than the budget airlines and thats difficult. ",,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Z¨¹rich,Sep-19,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""book another company""",24th August 2019,FALSE,"  First of all, I am not complaining about a specific flight. I am a Lufthansa frequent Flyer and I normally fly the route Munich - Timisoara. This summer season Lufthansa offered the flights on this route to Adria Airways, as they are a star alliance member. I can only tell that I have the worst experiences with them. In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows. The cabin crew is decent - not wow, not bad - but there also also situations when the staff are really rude and not customer oriented. I would recommend anyone to fly with this company. If you have the chance, book another company!",Bombardier CRJ,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Timisoara to Munich,Aug-19,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""combined two flights""",6th August 2019,TRUE,  Worst Airline ever! They combined two flights to save costs. Instead of flying Pristina - Ljubliana - Z¨¹rich we now fly Pristina - Ljubliana - M¨¹nchen - Z¨¹rich. Now we arrive 2.5h later at our destination.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pristina to Z¨¹rich via Ljubliana,Aug-19,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,8,"""the crew was nice""",12th October 2018,TRUE," Ljubljana to Munich. The homebase airport of Adria Airways is Ljubljana and it very small, relaxing and convenient. It is surrounded by the Alps and the departure was fantastic. The airplane was modern and the crew was nice. Ontime departure. Drinks without alcohol were free and I paid 4€ for my white wine. Considering that I had a cheap ticket I cannot complain. Upgrades would have been available for 30€ - which includes the lounge.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Munich,Oct-18,4,4,3,5,,,5,yes
Adria Airways,1,"""Very bad experience overall""",5th October 2018,FALSE,  Zurich to Ljubljana. Very poor customer service. Flight was cancelled without sending any email confirmation. The flight I was rebooked seemed to be overbooked at the beginning (which was not true)and we had to wait 30 min to have our ticket changed. Very bad experience overall.,,Business,Economy Class,Zurich to Ljubljana,Oct-18,2,1,,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""bad customer service""",29th July 2018,TRUE,"  Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer. And coffee was a nuisance and they made it clear, even though it was on their cart. The questions would normally go ""would you drink anything?"" and not ""what would you like to drink?"". Very bad customer service.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Sofia,Jul-18,4,1,1,4,,,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""overall very poor""",19th July 2018,TRUE,"  We were traveling from Paris to Skopje on May 4th, via Ljubljana. Our flight from Ljubljana to Skopje, was canceled 10 days before our departure for no reason, leaving us in the middle of our connection at Ljubljana. Even if the company booked a hotel for us and made sure we could take a flight the next day, it prevented us from enjoying one more day in Macedonia. The company had agreed to reimburse the hostel night we had already paid but more than two months after our claim we still have no reply from the company. I e-mailed the company two times, called them on multiple occasion. The company said I would be reimbursed after 2 months. 2 months later, I still have not received anything. The experience with Adria Airways was overall very poor : - flight canceled for no reason - 2 out of 4 of the flights we took were delayed - terrible customer service, unable to give any answer to our online claim and not reimbursing the hostel night we had already paid",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Skopje via Ljubljana,May-18,3,3,,3,,,2,no
Adria Airways,2,"""Would not fly again""",30th June 2018,TRUE,  Ljubljana to Munich. Adria's checkin system is obviously barely coping. It wasn't possible to obtain an electronic boarding pass (iphone wallet version) from Adria's site. The option was there but it failed without any further explanation. Further more I was not able to checkin to return flight online - neither through Adria nor Lufthansa web site. In the end I made it via Lufthansa mobile app. Go figure. Both issues were reported to customer care and both were ignored. I experienced the same customer care "policy" couple of years ago when my inquiry with customer support was basically ignored. Flight was actually operated by a Romanian company Carpatair. The cabin was outdated and dirty with a funny smell lingering around. The latter stuck to my clothes for the day - not that great if you are meeting a client. Cabin crew was also quite disorganised and mixed up orders of all passengers sitting around me. Would not fly again. Unfortunately they are the only company offering a direct flight from LJU to MUC.,,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Munich,Jun-18,1,2,2,2,,,1,no
Adria Airways,3,"""very unpleasant experience""",24th June 2018,TRUE,"  A very unpleasant experience for my family. We bought two return flights (Ljubljana-Prague-Ljubljana, Ljubljana-Warsaw-Ljubljana), and several days before departure both direct flights from and to Prague were canceled and a flight to Warsaw was merged with Prague flight (so added necessary stopover). Instead of a direct flight to Prague Adria Airways finally offered a transfer via Munich. When we arrived at the airport (21/6/2018), we found that the flight to Munich had more than an hour of delay, and therefore it was not possible to catch the next flight from Munich to Prague. The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline. Maybe it had been overloaded due to the number of disgruntled passengers because the next gate was full of people waiting for a delayed flight to Vienna, where there also wasn't anybody from Adria Airways who could provide any information. Unfortunately this flight left without us and we were all forced to ride from the Munich airport to a more than 30 km distant hotel and the next morning at 6am again back. Permanent cancellation of flights and subsequent ignorance of passengers are surely a way to reduce operating costs, but in the long-term this will cause the outflow of passengers to other airports around Slovenia, especially to Graz and to Zagreb.",A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Prague,Jun-18,3,3,,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,1,"""Flight was very comfortable""",4th May 2018,TRUE,"  Frankfurt to Ljubljana. Flight was very comfortable, professional crew. The monitors above passengers provide informations about flight (speed, altitude, temperature, time to landing, etc.)",,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Ljubljana,Apr-18,5,5,5,5,,,5,yes
Adria Airways,1,"""delayed for more than 2 hours""",11th March 2018,TRUE,"  Ljubljana to Frankfurt. Flight delayed for more than 2 hours due to technical problems. We were not given any food or water and when I requested some I was told to complain to Adria Airways website. Another plane was organized, more than 2 hrs later. The staff was trying to convince the passengers that their connection to Singapore will wait (they had 15 min in between the new flight arrival time and departure!), and that the flight to Frankfurt is 1 hr - and no wifi connectivity on flight!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Frankfurt,Mar-18,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Adria Airways,3,"""should be ashamed of their operations""",5th December 2017,TRUE,"  Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations. It's sad for an otherwise perfectly acceptable airline to lose a customer over 20EUR.",ATR-72,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Vienna,Sep-17,2,4,1,1,,,3,no
Adria Airways,9,"""Two nice short flights""",20th November 2017,TRUE," Two nice short flights from Ljubljana to Sarajevo and back. First flight with Adria, flight back with Adria Switzerland. Flight to Sarajevo delayed due to fog in Sarajevo, Adria quickly changed an aircraft so that it was possible to land in foggy weather (CRJ instead of ATR). Product depends weather it is Adria or Adria Switzerland. Adria with snack, water and buy on board product, Adria Switzerland with snack, water, tea and coffee and without buy on board. I personally prefer the second option. Adria Switzerland provided nicer and cosier atmosphere on board, somehow a kind of premium product compare to Adria mainline.",CRJ700 / ATR72,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Sarajevo,Nov-17,5,5,3,5,,,3,yes
Adria Airways,2,"""extremely bad service""",27th October 2017,FALSE, We were 11 people coming in with a short connection to Zurich hoping to continue with Adria to Ljubjana. We were before final call at the departure gate. Other people were still boarding. Adria had decided to rebook us and could not put us back on the plane. I and my wife had no checked in baggage. We had to wait 5 hours for next flight. This was extremely bad service and will do our utmost to never have to fly Adria again. We will also warn all our flying friends.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Ljubjana,Oct-17,3,3,,1,,,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""never fly this airline again""",16th September 2017,FALSE,"  Ljubljana to Munich after arriving from Atlanta on Delta. Flight was ok, short 50 min. But they lost our baggage, if we didn't persistently call the airport we wouldn't have our bags for a week because they are lazy. One bag was badly damaged and things missing. We did everything they told us to do to report it but they didn't honor it and it took 3 months for them to pay us around 20% of the replacements and extra expenses we had for days. Very rude, try to blame it on the customer, if you don't live in Slovenia and your only communication is over emails it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to reply even if you send them email right after they sent one. That day they lost baggage for 3 different passengers and when we had our return flight there were two more passengers that said they lost their bags so this is normal for that airline. It was a cheaper option to fly with them, but it was not worth the extra cost later. I would never fly this airline again. ",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Munich ,Jun-17,3,4,1,1,,1,2,no
Adria Airways,9,"""can't remember a flight delay""",19th April 2017,FALSE," Ljubljana to Zurich on April 18th. Adria Airways has become in recent years a more reliable airline which I use for these flights. I can't remember a delay and I fly them once a month. Flight Attendants are professionel. Food and Drinks (except water) have to be purchased. Sandwiches are tasty, wine choice could be better. Newspapers are available for free but mostly in Slovenian language only. Seat pitch on emergency exits are above international standards and safety seems to be their Nr. 1 aim as it is one of the rare airlines having extra safety instructions for passengers seated on emergency exit seats. Their inflight magazine is available online or printed. Not necessarily exciting but solid and reliable product which I can recommend.",CR9,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Zurich,Apr-17,5,5,4,5,4,,4,yes
Adria Airways,8,"""seat was quite comfortable """,27th January 2017,FALSE,"  Ljubljana to Vienna. After a fast boarding procedure the plane took off in time. The seat was quite comfortable although the cabin looked a bit nagged. Despite the fact that this was a regional flight, Adria Airways offered a Wifi service with good connection, an IFE system and free chat function amongst the passengers. A very friendly crew welcomed the passengers onboard and started their service which was pretty impressive for this 50 minutes flight. The business meal tasted great and we landed punctually in Vienna.",Canadair 700,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LJU to VIE,Dec-16,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,yes
Adria Airways,1,"""nice and comfortable flights""",10th November 2016,FALSE,"  Two very short flights with Adria Airways from Ljubljana to Vienna and back. Both on time.

Overall nice and comfortable flights.",CRJ900,Business,Economy Class,LJU to VIE,Oct-16,5,5,,5,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,8,"""what a great surprise""",9th November 2016,FALSE,"  I boarded the CRJ900 flight and at my seat I had the table down and on it a pre-flight snack, water and juice. What a great surprise as you arrive to your seat. Loved it. Although the meal wasn't the best, it was good and the wine very good. The first row is very spacious and lots of legroom, which is not always guaranteed for bulkhead. I find the new generation CRJ900 plane very comfy with big windows so was very pleased with the whole flight.",CRJ900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LJU to CPH,Nov-16,4,4,3,3,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,5,"""value for money is not there nor the experience""",3rd November 2016,FALSE,"  Fly only if no other connection, I am a frequent business flyer mostly departing from Vienna or Munich to destinations. The flight with Adria was chosen due to convenience, however if I had an option to choose next time, the value for money is not there nor the experience. Outdated aircraft (buzzing from AC in the upper compartment present the whole time of descending and extremly anoying. Complimentary glass of water and snack (pretzles). Other options only upon payment (does not seem acceptable fot the price over 400 eur). Not to mention online check in unavailable from Paris, while the traffic to the airport is unpredictable, hence online check in is a must. All in all I would fly Adria again only if there is no other option left. The aircraft staff though very nice.",,Business,Economy Class,CDG to LJU,Nov-16,3,5,1,4,3,3,1,no
Adria Airways,2,"""fleet is tired and outdated""",21st October 2016,FALSE,"  Munich to Ljubljana. Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services. I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).  I have found a solution to avoid flying Adria Airways where possible - Turkish Airlines presence is now pretty strong in LJU and I can't fault their service. Whenever flying into LJU from a geographical destination where IST is a logical place to transit, TK is my carrier of choice.",CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MUC to LJU,Oct-16,1,1,2,3,1,,1,no
Adria Airways,3,"""underwhelming and unimpressive""",10th October 2016,FALSE,"  Ljubljana to Amsterdam. First experience with Adria Airways was underwhelming and unimpressive. Flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation; causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in AMS. Crew was the least personal I've experienced in my 30+ flights in 2016. The crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it; everything else is buy-on-board at unappealing prices. Aging CRJ-900 showed its wear, limited on-air entertainment, but able to select bulkhead seat at check-in so legroom was good. Compared to inbound flight on Air France, Adria lacked any sort of the polished, personal touch that its in-flight magazine claims it wants to project. To LJU, however, the options are few and the schedules erratic, so Adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors.",CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LJU to AMS,Oct-16,3,1,1,2,2,,2,no
Adria Airways,3,"""very different experiences""",30th September 2016,FALSE,"  Ljubljana to Brussels. Two very different experiences. Flight from Ljubljana to Brussels nice and comfortable, CRJ900 cabin clean and pleasant. Very professional and nice cabin crew on JP376 flight on Aug 03. JP395 flight back on Aug 30 could not be more different. A319 cabin tired and uncomfortable, flight almost empty, cabin crew could not be more unprofessional, tired and not interested. A nightmare of a crew. The worst was a purser. I have never experienced such unmotivated flight attendant with totally not acceptable appearance. You can have a bad day, however even if it is your worst day ever, you should look professional enough for a flight purser. At the end of the day with buy on board service on JP flights the flight attendants make all the difference on board of the aircraft.",CRJ900 / A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LJU to BRU,Aug-16,2,2,,4,,,4,no
Adria Airways,6,"""staff were all pleasant enough""",4th September 2016,FALSE,"Booked this flight after many years using Easyjet, got the flight at a very reasonable price, actually cheaper than easyJet. Flight outbound and inbound were ok and although departing slightly late, we arrived pretty close to scheduled time, outbound landing in Ljubljana was a bit rough. The staff were all pleasant enough and served complementary water, a small selection of other food and drink were for sale but some advertised items were not available. Seating is now a bit cramped with even less leg room than Easyjet, I am just 6' and my kness were toching the seat in front and were crushed further by the person in front moving and the person behind digging their knees into my back as thay wer oviosly struggling for room too.

Adria Airways,3,"""Adria do not take criticism well""",6th August 2016,FALSE,"  Gatwick to Ljubljana. Do not rely on Adria Airways to be communicative when anything goes wrong.

Everything else - from cola to candy to croissant - available for purchase. Was able to select my seat in advance.

Small and cramped cabin in a clean CRJ700. The flight LCJ-CDG was nearly empty, so I felt like being in a private jet. MUC-LCJ with 65% load factor. Check-in via internet with an option to select seats without any problem, both flights on time. Cabin staff rather absent, just served a glass of water for free. Although we were informed about possibility to connect to on-board wi-fi, I couldn't manage to do that.

No free snacks or even drinks, which is very sad for a Star Alliance partner, because their fare prices are high but offer is similar to low cost airlines.

Very friendly and helpful staff - excellent business class service including a hot meal, warm bread cheese and marmalade. Better than the LH business class service. Flight arrived 25 minutes before STA - good job. Information about the route, weather and connections were given by the captain. Legroom in row 1 good, nice seats. Highly recommended this small but very functional airline.",A319,Business,Business Class,SKP to LJU,Sep-15,5,5,5,5,4,,5,yes
Adria Airways,5,"""service onboard was poor""",9th September 2015,FALSE,"Frankfurt to Ljubljana with Adria Airways. Boarding was on-time, but aircraft was parked on remote gate about 15 minutes from main terminal. So we departed about 25 minutes late. Service onboard was poor, with no complimentary drinks or snacks - they are available only for sale. Arrival was 15 minutes later than scheduled. Crew was friendly.",CRJ 900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Ljubljana,Feb-15,4,3,,3,,,3,no
Adria Airways,6,"""service of a low cost airline""",4th September 2015,FALSE,"Adria Airways has the price of a regular airline, but the service of a low cost airline. All the beverages and food are for purchase. The seats are fine, staff is friendly. Since we usually travel very early in the morning or very late in the evening, we use the flight to rest. Every time we ask for a pillow, we get one. It might sound strange, but this is very important for us.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Brussels,Aug-15,4,5,,5,,,2,yes
Adria Airways,1,"""staff friendly but unobtrusive""",2nd September 2015,FALSE,"Excellent flights both ways with Adria Airways from Manchester to Ljubljana. Staff friendly but unobtrusive. Leg room far better than most economy flights, seats comfy and plenty of storage space. Flights on time, quick and efficient boarding and disembarking, smooth take offs and landings.

Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,10th April 2015,FALSE,Outbound flight FRA/PRN A319. 2 hours 10 min flight. I thought drinks/snacks for sale but sandwich soft drinks were served complimentary. Inbound flights SKP/LJU/FRA CRJ900. each 1 hour 30 min flight. Skyshop menu was in a seat pocket and drinks/snacks were for sale. All flight crews were friendly. Security check at the Ljubljana airport for transit passengers was chaos however it's possible to go to a gate within 30min.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,0,,4,yes
Adria Airways,1,Adria Airways customer review,5th January 2015,FALSE,Two short hops ZRH-LJU and LJU-VIE. Very fast on CRJ 90. Seats comfortable and crew was fine. Ground services good and lounge was quite nice.,,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,,1,,5,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,14th September 2014,FALSE,Flew Zurich-Ljubljana on JP365 newish CRJ900. Flight almost full departure on time. Service on board by 2 pleasant and friendly female flight attendants. I bought coffee mineral water and a very nice and fresh filled croissant for EUR 6. Good value!,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,0,,5,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,6th September 2014,FALSE,Adria serves this 100 min flight from Ljubljana to Amsterdam on a brand new CRJ900 Next Gen which has a hugely improved cabin. Much more spacious higher ceiling and with big windows. The seats seem to be more comfortable and have more legroom. The business class is not separated from the main cabin though not even with the standard back seat curtain. The food offering could be slightly improved for usually I've had good meals on Adria.,,,Business Class,,,4,4,3,,1,,4,yes
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,16th June 2014,FALSE,WAW-SKJ Economy. No free snacks or drinks on this Star Alliance partner. Just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline. Flying out of Poland had no Euros or USD on me. I was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water. The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be "difficult". She never offered me a tiny cup of water. On the way back I switched to Turkish Airlines via IST and got a free 3 course meal on both segments and friendly service.,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,1,,2,,2,no
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,8th June 2014,FALSE,Sarajevo-Frankfurt via Ljubljana. I loved flying with them. Very small airline but a functional one. Crew friendly on board nothing special regarding entertainment or service. But flight duration's were short too so nothing to complain about. What I loved the most was a fast transit process in Ljubljana since its small airport and immigration was very fast. Would choose them again on my future trips.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,,3,,4,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,1st June 2014,FALSE,I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their web-site. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,1,,0,,3,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,10th May 2014,FALSE,LJU to FRA and back both flights were on time. Flights were made by CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Very clean cabin and comfortable seats. Staff were always nice and friendly. New SkyShop service was excellent with nice prices and it's not too expensive.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,3,,4,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,13th January 2014,FALSE,On my Ljubljana - Munich flight in business class Adria used the CRJ-900 Next Generation which is a great plane. I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you don't have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. It's a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.,,,Business Class,,,4,3,4,,1,,4,yes
Adria Airways,1,Adria Airways customer review,6th January 2014,FALSE,Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time. In Economy class was served just coffee tea an water but it's fine for one and a half hour flight. Very friendly and helpful cabin crew members. Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,,4,,4,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,22nd October 2013,FALSE,I was very satisfied with the CRJ 900 on my flight from Zagreb to Istanbul. The aircraft's are very clean fresh new and the staff was very helpful. Besides I felt very safe and comfortable in the aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,4,,4,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,28th August 2013,FALSE,I was on JP650 the evening departure to Istanbul on 28th August. It was on a very clean Airbus A319 and it was a light load flight. The crew were warm and kind especially the Purser who took her time walked and talked to several passengers. They even offered me a pillow and blanket which I appreciated. A warm refreshment with selections of cold/hot beverage were offered on this 2 hours flight. We took off about 5 minutes earlier and landed more or less 20 minutes earlier. It was a relaxing flight and I do hope they will be flying to more destinations in the future since Slovenia is a beautiful and lovely country to visit.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,3,,3,,5,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,19th August 2013,FALSE,VIE-LJU LJU-MUC Aug 4-15th CRJ200. Both flights very good. Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through. Would highly recommend this little regional airline and Slovenia is beautiful.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,,0,,4,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,19th August 2013,FALSE,If I have to fly a regional jet then I prefer the new generation CRJ 900 which Adria used on today's flight from Amsterdam to Ljubljana. It has much bigger windows which makes the cabin look more spacious. Despite Adria cutting back on a lot of their routes for what it is the service food and cabin is OK.,,,Business Class,,,3,3,4,,1,,4,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,10th June 2013,FALSE,Istanbul-Ljubljana-Munich and return. Pre-take off on all sectors given an individual bottle of water and plastic glass. During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm. Also that the Slovenian liqueur speciality advertised in their in-flight Duty Free catalogue is not carried on board. All flights on time.,,,Business Class,,,2,5,4,,0,,4,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,27th May 2013,FALSE,Return flight Paris-Skopje via Ljubljana. All flights were on time and nice very clean planes / good flight crew. Seats were comfortable enough for a 1-2 hours flight. Boarding was easy for all flights. Ljubljana airport is very small and nice. The only downside is the absence of any snack. FA served only water and coffee/tea. This is almost like low cost airline. It is recommended airline for short flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,1,,0,,4,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,8th October 2012,FALSE,BEG-LJU-BEG with CRJ200 great regional airline with excellent airport. Too bad the airport is not too busy. Both flights were on time and they had Duty Free service with certain items on special prices. Their tickets are not good may be that is a reason that they are on economic difficulties.,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,,0,,2,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,4th July 2012,FALSE,I fly at least once a month ZRH-LJU-ZRH. My experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers. If it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are. The airplanes could be cleaned better and I do also see some room for improvement for the flight staff.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,17th June 2012,FALSE,LTN to LJU outbound with CRJ200 return with CRJ900. Both legs on time. Just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight. Slow and unfriendly staff. Very little room in CRJ200 even though it was not full. Passengers had to pick up their luggage from hold upon arrival to LJU and carry the bags to the terminal building.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,8,Adria Airways customer review,12th June 2012,FALSE,Ljubljana to Brussels with CRJ900. Boarding on time. The aircraft looked quite new and very clean. Meal served was above my expectations. Cabin crew were very nice. The only thing that was bad was the seating arrangement. I sat in 13th or 14th row and that row didn't have any windows! Otherwise flight was ok.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,16th February 2012,FALSE,LJU-FRA and FRA-LJU. First flight on time return flight slightly delayed due to heavy snow in FRA. Flight attendants attentive and helpful. Delicious snacks on both flights. While waiting for take off on first leg passengers were served Slovenian sparkling wine juices and water. Comfortable seats and generous leg- room with CRJ 900 to FRA and CRJ 200 to LJU. Both airplanes very clean and seemingly well maintained all in all quite an enjoyable experience.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,17th January 2012,FALSE,LJU-FRA-LJU. Both flights on time. Flight attendants are friendly however they allowed 3 different versions of female uniforms on the same flight. A white T-shirts under an apron looks very casual for a flag-carrier. The planes are quite worn and promotional messages on the seats for an insurance company look cheap. Food is ok taking in consideration that it was just an 1 hour flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,20th September 2011,FALSE,Smart and efficient service. Small planes but as a tall man (6ft 4) I did not feel cramped either on the CRJ-200 (AMS-LJU) or the CRJ-900 (LJU-AMS). The cabin crew were friendly and the food for such a short flight was good. Also the price was right.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,9,Adria Airways customer review,13th September 2011,FALSE,FRA-VIE in Business Class. A great little airline transferred to them after our transatlantic flight. The advantage for the CRJ sitting on a remote stand was that we got a really interesting ride around Frankfurt airport with operating aircraft taxiing landing taking off all around us. Onboard the crew were pleasant and managed to serve a hot lunch to us during the 60 mins flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,1,Adria Airways customer review,13th September 2011,FALSE,London Gatwick to Ljubljana and Ljubljana to Vienna in Business Class. Delayed slightly at Gatwick but that happens. Otherwise very good flights. Cabin crew friendly and welcoming ensuring that you were okay - without being too pushy and forward. Short flights and light meals/snacks served.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,19th January 2011,FALSE,ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,7th January 2011,FALSE,I fly Adria a lot (at least once a month) and find them ok. The service is mixed. Often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is no-one to greet. Last time when I boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished. Food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the CRJ aircraft.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,10th October 2010,FALSE,I fly Adria quite a lot (aprox 2 flts a month). My routes are normally VIE-LJU or ZRH-LJU. I always wondered why Adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus. The CRJ200 and 1000 are OK specially 1000 which are brand new and also A319 latest delivery. I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer. There were old inflight magazines in cabin. Crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no
Adria Airways,6,Adria Airways customer review,25th November 2009,FALSE,This was my first time with Adria. Short hop from KBP to LJU. The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use "wrong" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes
Adria Airways,7,Adria Airways customer review,27th May 2009,FALSE,ZRH-LJU-ZRH with CRJ-900. New plane with pleasant cabin interior and comfortable leather seats. Flights on time food ok. Adria Airways has new uniforms (60 style) and the flight attendants are attentive. Web-Check-in works excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,5,Adria Airways customer review,26th May 2009,FALSE,It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes
Adria Airways,3,Adria Airways customer review,28th February 2009,FALSE,LGW-LJU in Y class. Adria Airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great. Boarding quick and efficient. Plane downgraded from CRJ9 to CRJ2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured. Waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck. Service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks. Cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances. If crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,29th May 2008,FALSE,London to Tirana via Ljubljana Economy Class. 30 minutes late on first leg due to air traffic restrictions at Gatwick but Adria held the connecting flight for us even though there were only a handful of people transferring from the London flight. The food was adequate on both legs and the crew were friendly. All in all a perfectly acceptable journey and I would fly Adria again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,12th May 2008,FALSE,Ljublijana-Amsterdam. A great little airline. Although the CRJ-200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew. Their inflight magazine is in English and Slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information. Same can't be said about Brnk international airport however! This airport needs a 'spruce up' to say the least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,4,Adria Airways customer review,11th February 2008,FALSE,FRA-VIE-FRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea & coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,4th October 2007,FALSE,BRU-LJU-BRU. Outward flight on a CRJ200 very nice - comfortable excellent service and a good breakfast. Return flight on a 737 leased from Ukrainian airlines was also reasonable despite the limited legroom. Earning Star Alliance points also a plus - would recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,8th August 2007,FALSE,I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,14th July 2007,FALSE,LGW-LJU-LGW on an older but clean A320. Outwards in 7A with plenty of legroom return in 12F with adequate legroom but need to be careful as the plastic shell on the bottom of the seat in front had started to crack with some sharp edges. Cheese roll served outbound and a jam filled croissant on the return - better than nothing but room for improvement. Coffee and soft drinks free but only one round early in the flight. Very pleasant crew on both sectors. Only gripe was baggage collection at LJU - three flights on one carousel and they seemed to unload baggage in batches from each flight turn about which caused chaos. The second carousel sat unused for the first 40 minutes waiting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,24th March 2007,FALSE,Frankfurt-Ljubljana-Munich in business class: the first flight was on a B737 in the colours of Ukraine International and that plane's interior was substandard while the second flight was on a new CRJ. Both flights on time and without glitch. The service is friendly but meals should be improved. Overall they gave the impression of being a pleasant short haul airline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,9th October 2006,FALSE,Zurich-Ljubljana return. About 2 hours+ journey. Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read. You board the planes on the tarmac via buses from the gates though and not through connecting bridges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,29th September 2006,FALSE,LGW-LJU return. Outbound was on A320 seated towards the front of Y-class on a very empty flight. The crew were friendly enough and served a ham or cheese roll and round of drinks. LJU airport was easy to use and out within minutes. The coach ride into town goes through some nice Slovenian countryside. Return was on a B737-500 flight was full and had a middle seat but exit row (9E) seat pitch was great. Again right after take off was served with a cream pie desert and drinks. Crew were again friendly and another smooth flight that landed about 15mins ahead of schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,27th September 2006,FALSE,LGW-LJU-LGW last week overall impressed with standard of service on A320. The food in economy was very basic but I didn't expect any! Drinks free. Was allocated row 11 (emergency exit) with out asking she said your very tall(6'4) I will give you some more leg room! Only minor complaint was the seat base comfort it was rock hard like sitting on a wood bench. On the return the seat in row 25 was little better they seem to have cut back on the foam. Crew were excellent a nice airline all in all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,2nd August 2006,FALSE,DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,21st February 2006,FALSE,Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes. It was perhaps a bit cramped on board the Canadair Regional Jet though I wouldn't complain about it. Crew was overall quite friendly and efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,1st October 2005,FALSE,Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,15th September 2005,FALSE,Round trip LGW - LJU in Economy Class both legs on an A320. Service pretty friendly planes clean & well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey. All-in-all a pretty reasonable experience with no major complaints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,3rd December 2004,FALSE,I have used their VIE-FRA-VIE service several times. All flights were on time the atmosphere on board (CRJ) fine service is friendly although their snack and drinks are not outstanding. But for a flight of 1 hour what should it be? Codesharing with LH enables to collect miles though they dont count for status.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,18th March 2004,FALSE,Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,1st November 2003,FALSE,Round trip LGW - LJU in Business Class. Check-in staff at LGW very efficient and friendly. A320 clean and staff most helpful. Food and Wine need improvement. Flights all on time and overall a pleasant experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,31st July 2003,FALSE,In July 2003 I flew London (Gatwick)-Ljubljana-Skopje return in Business Class. Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,6th December 2002,FALSE,I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Adria Airways,n,Adria Airways customer review,25th August 2002,FALSE,I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""Very poor service""",24th July 2023,TRUE,"  At check-in, we were told that our checked baggage was too heavy (limit 8kg/17lbs even though the website said 23kg/50lb limit), and we needed to reduce the weight. We were put to the side so we could move our dirty laundry from the suitcases and put into tote bags (purchased from the nearby shop) that we could carry on. This was both embarrassing and frustrating. The plane was an hour late for our connecting flight. They didn't tell us, but fortunately (after running through the airport), our connection was also late, so we did make the plane. They stopped food service short, so the last 5 rows didn't get any food. This was not due to weather, but just bad timing of the stewards. We still had 30 minutes to land, so they could have quickly handed out the sandwiches, but they decided not to provide service to the last few rows. I don't know if it was due to poor planning of the start of food service, or of taking too much time in the middle rows. Instead of treating us like the rest of the passengers, we felt like 3rd class citizens. Very poor service.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heraklion to Istanbul via Athens,Jul-23,2,1,1,1,4,2,1,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""We expected meaningful compensation""",19th July 2023,TRUE,"  I had a flight me and my husband from Stockholm to Cairo with connection flight in Athens. The connecting flight number was A3930, from Athens to Cairo. The planned departure time was 11:55 pm June 25th. The flight was delayed by nearly 6 hours from the planned departure time. We were informed the flight will be delayed for 1 hour before boarding. Before the new departure time, we boarded normally. After that, a lot of time has passed ¡° more that 1 hour¡± while we are inside the aircraft and we don¡¯t take off and no information were given to us by the crew. From the aircraft windows we could see some workers taking bags in and out the aircraft. The crew told us they are having problems with luggage.  We are kept in the aircraft to nearly 4 hours before the captain told us that we can leave the aircraft and go to sit in the airport till the problem is solved.  Nothing was offered to us in the airport, no food, drinks or anything. In the meantime I tried to contact the Aegean Airlines hotline to help us, it was nearly 5:00 am already, but the contact person told me that she can not know any information about my flight situation because she has a limited access to information and she cannot help and I can call again after 7:00 am for another contact who has more access. At nearly 6:00 am the crew called us to board again but we didn¡¯t take off till 6:35 anyways because the crew was replaced by a new one. We reached Cairo airport finally to find that our baggage didn¡¯t reach Cairo airport anyway and we waited for 2 weeks till they reached Cairo airport. The delay collectively was from 11:55 pm to 6:35 am. We expected an apology on what happened and meaningful compensation as an acknowledgment of what they did. We complained to the company and their reply was that they were sorry for the delay and they offered the least compensation stated by passengers¡¯ rights ¡°250 euros¡±.

They asked me if I want the same seats, I said yes and they put me and the 5 month old baby in different seats. I asked that obviously we need to be together. Then they moved me in to row 19. Then they couldn¡¯t find me on the flight, they couldn¡¯t give me a seat with the excuse that it¡¯s not for the baby when it was before.

It was the most frustrating, time-consuming and displeasing experience imaginable when attempting to travel via plane. No matter what, never use Aegean Airlines under any circumstances.

Aegean Airlines,1,"""pretty bad track record""",11th July 2023,FALSE," We took 3 flights with Aegean and would not recommend them to anyone. Had 3 issues: 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead, but checked in about 18 hours before our flight (they allow check-in up to 24 hours ahead). We were issued a ¡°standby¡± ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate, we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didn¡¯t then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight, or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn¡¯t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn¡¯t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn¡¯t happen to us, but it¡¯s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too. All-in-all, this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Chania,Jul-23,3,3,1,1,,,2,no

These were two short flights consisting of Sophia, Bulgaria to Athens and Athens to Larnaca, Cyprus. Both flights were exceptional. The flights were smooth and the seats were comfortable. The cabin service was outstanding. We received a snack (more of a light meal) on each flight, and both were delicious. The first flight included a small sandwich roll with sliced chicken and cheese; the second flight included a pasta salad with tuna and dressing. We enjoyed every bite! As we were leaving the plane in Larnaca I commented to the cabin staff at the exit of the plane that Aegean Airlines was now my new favorite airline. And it is. I opted to give the airline a rating of 9 instead of 10 due to two items: both flights were short. Had the flights been longer (more of a test of the airline service), I would have given the maximum rating. Also, Aegean's website is not as intuitive as most others I've used.

An old ATR POS that Aegean must likely keep to connect some small islands that cannot accommodate jets. Why they would use these consistently for the third largest Greek island is unclear to me. Once seated in 15C and having put my backpack above, I see the flight attendant pushing it to make space for someone's big suitcase.

The second problem was when I was about to board in Athens, when it was my turn they stopped me and asked for a Moroccan visa or residence permit, I said my passport didn't need a visa to Morocco for up to 3 months and I even gave him a look at the Moroccan visa policy and he really didn't care.

Passengers were told initially that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes, then another delay announcement just as passengers were getting emails informing of flight cancellation. The ground crew were poor at making sure there was clarity in their announcements. I went up to a staff member when most people who appeared to be Corfu residents had just gone home, and asked was there any hotel booking arrangements - ""No"", any hotel used in such circumstances, don't know, any cost max, don't know, what about meals, don't know. Reclaiming? - ""you have to go to Aegean office in Athens"". I spoke to a British Corfu resident who said most expensive hotel open was Corfu Palace. I chose to go somewhere with a little better location and not so expensive. I then found out from the lady that just after I left, she was told that anyone needing a hotel could go to the Corfu Palace and all meals etc were covered and no need to pay. So, overall great experience - really well done ground crew: vital information not provided on a timely basi. The later flight was full as the following day was a general strike in Greece - so 2 nights had to stay in Corfu. On return flight cabin crew tolfd me there was no issue with the weather, the aircraft had a fault that could not be fixed in Corfu. Aegean states 10 days to get back to passenger with complaint, it is now 19 days.  It is now 19 days and not a word from Aegean. This was my 3rd flight with Aegean.

We ordered it, was asked to wait while the cabin crew was giving out hot food. After 20min we asked again and we were asked to wait. After another 20min, she started to cry uncontrollably, and we walked up to the crew (who was still busy giving out hot meal) that we really needed to give our child some water. When we finally got it, it was impossible to stop our girl from crying even when she got the water (well, most parents would understand that it was too late and the damage has already been done). So after calming her down (which took another 10-15min) she started to drink and became happy again. It was a bad experience for everyone, our 2 year old, us as her parents and all other passengers. A situation that could easily have been avoided, which would have been nice as flying with kids often means stress. Why couldn¡¯t a person in the crew just stop for 1minute and help out?

Especially the new planes are really nice, and the service on board is good too. The food is really not that bad, especially in business class. However, Economy is great as well. There are some nice touches with Aegean, like how they inform you when your flight is delayed. They email you, and you get a notification in the app. About the app, it works really good.

And I could say that 90% of the times their flights are delayed, specially the ones towards the end of the day. And it is not due to the overall mess that happened this past summer I'm so many European airpors. I can understand that delays pile up along the day but, knowing that this happens, they should review their schedules. Or try to catch up during the flight. The excuse is most times the same, the ridiculous ""late arrival of the aircraft"" (thank you!). Their app is also faulty lately (you call then, show them, and still don't accept it, things like not being able to check in, wrong pricing information, no incoming messages with flight delays, etc. Also, when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat, you have to call them to get a refund! What they don't miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board (""forcing"" you to chose an area of improvement!), while not asking for the end-to-end experience (from reservation, check in, baggage drop, boarding, disembarkation, luggage).

I bought two tickets and by right have combined baggage of 46kgs - however, when we dropped off our baggage, the staff told us Aegean don't combine baggage and charged us for excessive baggage charges although our actual bags combined only 43kgs. Also they dont accept one of our hand carry suitcase as well which have been travelled through so many airlines like Qatar and Swiss with no issues and charge us another baggage charges.

Upon arrival in Skopje we were informed our luggage had been lost. We filed a lost baggage report at the Skopje airport. Once in Skopje all we had was the clothes on our backs. We spent the first two days of our vacation milling around an unknown city trying to find clothing and personal items and dealing with Aegean Airlines dysfunctional bureaucracy. On August 10, 2022, we returned home to the States empty handed and no word from Aegean regarding our lost luggage. Our calls and emails went unanswered. 10 days later we finally received our luggage that was come how found in Austria. We filed a reimbursement claim for initial expenses accrued in Skopje, for personal items and clothing replacement. Once again no word from Aegean. I repeated this process 3 times to no avail.

When I tried using the voucher the funds were not applied. The cashier told me to go speak with an Aegean Airline employee.

On the 2nd flight, I did see an attendant walking around the airport waiting room looking at bags, but she never weighed or measured anything. Both times the planes were delayed, though in their defense, most of the time I've flown in Europe pre and post pandemic, flights are delayed. The flight attendants were nice on both flights - always smiles and always helping. They never seemed to be unhappy, and some of the best I've encountered. I was impressed that they served a light meal and a beverage on my 3.5 hour flight and beer or wine didn't cost anything. Tui on the other hand, for the same length of flight, charged for food and/or drink and the leg room was much smaller, though their TUI allows 10kgs of carry-on luggage v. 8kgs for Aegean. I'd rather have the luggage allowance higher than the light meal and drink.

The male purser, during the preflight information, informed transfer passengers to check luggage procedures in Athens in the inflight magazine - we did it and found out that connecting in Athens from Non-Schengen to Schengen means you have to pick up your luggage, take it through customs and check it in again. With the official 1:05h connecting time it sounded sporty. A biscuit, yogurt, and drinks were served as breakfast, then crew then went behind the curtains and did not show up again until the final approach to Athens. During the descent, they asked the passengers to put the garbage including cups with liquids into the seat pockets. Delayed by 40 minutes we landed in Athens.

I said I can put the backpack in the cabin bag, but they refused as this would make it heavier. They clearly didn't want to help me and actually told to to hurry up and pay the fine or I would miss the flight, as people were boarding.

Despite a nearly 2 hour connection, one of our priority tagged bags did not make it (together with 30 other bags) on the flight from ATH to CPH. It is quite impressive that Gold Air handling missed a whole trolley of bags. Flight to CPH was fine. Good service and quite nice new seats in Business Class (empty middle seat). Breakfast OK, not fantastic. Service was good and attentive as always with this airline. Bag trouble took 1 hour to register in CPH. Friendly service but took a while. One of our bags arrived on the wrong bag belt after us asking where it was. The other bag was left in Athens. Bag arrived following day late at night on a strange bag delivery service as I had to come down to the delivery truck and visually point at my bag. Strange and not very professional. Bottom line, poor to lose a priority bag in a two hour connection. And, by the way, I do not like the way this airline randomly pick on economy people to weigh their bags. In my opinion is either all or none. Not some poor people who has to face a huge cost because of one kg overweight hand luggage. What is really the point of upsetting people.

I've reluctantly accepted, considering that my girlfriend and I go very often to Greece because we love it and we have dear friends there. The voucher, due to the Covid emergency still not allowing us to use it, expired. When I asked a reimbursement, as per point 9 of their Terms & Conditions policy, they have deliberately ignored all the emails I have sent.

The level of English was broken at best and there was no attempt on the part of the airline to understand and rectify the issue. The complaints process was long and difficult to use. I tried to use the discount voucher codes for Covid-19 tests that the Aegean website was offering however, there were issues with using the codes so there was no way of using discount.

Aegean Airlines,1,"""only middle seats were available for free""",4th April 2022,TRUE,"  I booked a ComfortFlex ticket for a midday flight from Athens to Thessaloniki on April 3rd. We had a change in our plans and I had to change my ticket to an evening flight. This particular fare allows changes for the same day with no fee and seats were available on the new flight so I logged into my reservation and changed the flight successfully.  I then tried to reserve a window seat on the new flight but noticed that only middle seats were available for free. This seemed strange since the flight was not sold out and ComfortFlex tickets allow free seating in the entire aircraft except for the exit row seats, where a charge applies. I then noticed that the only window or aisle seats available on my new flight were those at the exit row and those would involve an extra 9 Euro charge. As I'm about to proceed with the payment of this 9 Euro charge, my boyfriend informs me he will be joining me on the same flight. We book a new ticket for him and when we reach the seat map on his reservation, we can see plenty window and aisle seats available for free. We decide to call the Aegean call center to inquire why our reservations show different seats maps even though we've both purchased ComfortFlex tickets and we're traveling on the same flight. Their response was that it must be a systemic error and if we wanted, we could wait until going to the airport and request a window or an aisle seat there. If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the ""system"". It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare.  We paid the 9 Euro fee this time but from our main choice, they will become our last choice until they get their act together. And of course it came as no surprise to read so many other reviews here from other passengers complaining about similar situations.

Aegean Airlines,1,"""Excellent service from start to finish""",3rd April 2022,FALSE,"  Check-in procedure carried out professionally by extremely polite and communicative staff. Hand luggage was checked to ensure compliance with Aegean 's terms and conditions which it did. Breezed through Passport control despite the terminal being quite busy. Ample and polite staff kept queues short. Aegean Airlines terminal was spotlessly clean with ample duty free shopping available. Amazing authentic Greek food products like Greek baklava, feta and extra virgin olive oils were on promotion. Had to buy some. Boarding was orderly and we were greeted at aircraft door by immaculately dressed cabin crew. I am always impressed by how professional Aegean Airlines cabin crew are. They put Turkish Airlines crews to shame. On time departure with on board service of drinks and meal again served in a very professional and polite manner with a smile. Duty free trolley appeared after the meal service. Smooth flight, landed 20 minutes early. Excellent service from start to finish. Thoroughly recommended.",A320 NEO,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to London,Mar-22,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,yes
Aegean Airlines,1,"""it is clear that they are in a steep decline""",1st April 2022,TRUE," Both me and my wife are frequent business travelers and Gold Miles & Bonus members. Aegean Airlines started off as a promising, refreshing presence in the Greek market but it is clear that they are in a steep decline. We've experienced such poor customer service in the last several years on a number of occasions. Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled). Missed connections due to flight delays where they failed to assist us to reach our destination or arrange overnight accommodation for us. We were asked to cover the expenses on our own and then submit the receipts to receive compensation. We've taken trips where we were asked to pay service fees to change Comfort Flex and Business Class tickets. These two categories are their most unrestrictive fares and allow same day changes without a penalty, yet on a number of occasions, when their website failed to successfully change our tickets, we were asked to pay a service fee to proceed with the change. I could go on and on with a number of other disappointing practices but all in all, it seems that they've adopted policies and restrictions that we only find present with the so called low-cost carriers. All while charging full service carrier regular fares. Until they re-adjust their policies to a more customer service oriented level, we will certainly avoid flying with them in the future. Enough is enough.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Athens to Santorini,Apr-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""friendly and professional staff""",6th March 2022,TRUE,"  I was traveling to Stockholm, always with Aegean which for me is the top airline in Europe. It is not only service, the friendly and professional staff but also, one of the few airlines that offer meals included in the ticket price. And the meals are really great. In this flight a big surprise was the desert offered on the menu of the flight, Greeks call it ""pasteli"" which is a traditional sweet with honey and sesame seeds. The one of the flight, Navarino Icons Pasteli, was exceptional!!! It was so tasty, fresh and I was surprised that looking for the brand I discovered that it is a product of Costa Navarino which is a luxury sustainable destination and resorts and the opposite of an industrial product.

Boarding was orderly and greeted at aircraft door by polite and immaculately dressed cabin crew. On time departure, clean aircraft inside and outside. Seats are comfortable with adequate legroom. Drinks service and snack served. Attentive crew. Toilets at rear of plane in Economy were clean. Smooth flight, landed early.

Aegean Airlines,6,"""overall experience is very pleasant""",20th February 2022,FALSE,"  Staff are friendly and the overall experience from ground and cabin crew is very pleasant. Families were given priority when flying from Athens and luggage is usually checked in at no cost (if within size/weight limit). Seats are fairly tight, as expected, but overall pretty comfortable. Planes are new with USB charging on board and if you are lucky, a basic on-board wi-fi streaming service. Food quality is really bad, a tiny cold sandwich, served in a very environmentally-unfriendly card box. Drinks choice is OK. The part that lets this airline down is cleanliness. I expect a spotless cabin, only to find carpets are dirty, which is surprising for a brand new plane, seats have no headrest cover and toilets the worst I have ever seen on a plane.",A320 neo,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to London,Feb-22,2,4,2,5,1,1,2,yes
Aegean Airlines,4,"""No warm food was offered""",5th January 2022,TRUE,"  Boarding was done with bus to remote location. Cabin staff were just professional but not friendly. In flight service (breakfast) was in a cardboard box consisting of a cream and a sweet in plastic. There was a option of sandwiches, but they ran out. With the high priced ticket a shame to provide such inflight service. No warm food was offered. The flight was on time.

Aegean Airlines,1,"""bags would be above the 8 kilos allowed""",31st December 2021,TRUE,  My wife and I booked a trip on Expedia. The rate for economy class seemed acceptable although it restricted us to a single carry-on of no more than 8 kilos. At the airport duty free we bought some items and when tried to board we were told that we had to pay 60 extra euros for the duty free bag. When we tried to put the contents into our carry-on they told us that we would still have to pay the 60 euros since our bags would be above the 8 kilos allowed. In the end we had to pay or lose our flight. ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Paris,Dec-21,2,4,2,1,,,1,no
Aegean Airlines,1,"""Best value for money""",25th December 2021,TRUE,"  Aegean Airlines are the best airline in Europe. They keep on doing an amazing job.

Aegean Airlines,4,"""It was very stressful and inconvenient""",7th December 2021,TRUE,"  
I had to change flights in Athens. We were landing at 15.30 and my boarding time to the other flight was at 15.30! I asked if someone would take us to the other gate and they told me there would be a ""transit ambassador"". I started looking but no ambassador. They were sending me for PLF control which I already had in Prague and no one knew where was this ambassador. I had to pass again from security control. It was very stressful and inconvenient.",,Business,Economy Class,Prague to Athens via Heraklion,Dec-21,4,4,3,1,3,,1,no
Aegean Airlines,5,"""some things are really frustrating""",15th November 2021,TRUE,"  I dislike the fact that on too many arrivals this airline has not approached passenger walkways, and is choosing the bus as if we are still in the 50s. This was the case on our flight from Larnaca to Athens on 10/11 arriving with more than an hour delay, which was not announced until we were on board, and in Athens the bus like sardines despite the pandemic. The very expensive fare is not justified by a tiny sandwich they give you in flight, and you are given a choice of a fee seat only at the two last rows right next to the toilet, that is is such a place they give you 6 only free seats. You pay very dearly for the ticket, pay extra for luggage or anything over 8 kg, pay extra for a seat or take the seat next to the toilet. The plane is perfect, inflight service excellent, pilots top class, yet some things are really frustrating.",A320NEO,Business,Economy Class,Larnaca to Athens,Nov-21,4,5,2,4,,,2,no
Aegean Airlines,2,"""faced to pay my seat change""",4th November 2021,TRUE,"  I was unable to check in for some reason and I was given a seat in the middle. I tried to change it but after check-in at Oslo for the SAS flight, check-in kiosk couldn¡¯t change it so I called Aegean. After 3 calls to the customer service line I was instructed it is fixed and I should check-in on the app paying for my seat change.

Aegean Airlines,7,"""The biggest letdown are the seats""",10th October 2021,TRUE," On this trip they used a A320neo which is noticeably quieter then the regular one. The all female cabin staff was acting friendly and efficiently. We received a lunchbox consisting of a sandwich and a tasty honey-sesame cookie. A limited range of drinks was served as well. They use the airfi on-board WiFi system for games, news, real-time map etc. The biggest letdown are the seats, with an incredibly tight pitch. Even the ones at Wizz Air have more legroom.",A320 neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Munich,Oct-21,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,yes
Aegean Airlines,7,"""Nothing to complain about""",2nd October 2021,TRUE,"  Nothing to complain about. Stuttgart to Heraklion/Crete on Sept. 21st and return on Oct. 1st. We booked Aegean for the convenient flight times and their decent luggage policy in the Eco ComfortFlex Fare. Both flights were 100% on time. Check-in procedures were quick and efficient. Due to the chaotic conditions at Heraklion Airport Aegeans punctuality and efficiency cannot be appreciated enough. Flight was ok. The crew was not overly motivated but helpful and friendly. There was a free snack and beverage service, which was nothing special but more than other airlines offer. Interior of plane was a little run down but seat comfort and leg space were ok. Overall the Eco Comfort Flex Fare is a very good value for money. Too bad, Aegean doesn't offer a Business Class on their HER flights, at least not out of STR.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stuttgart to Heraklion,Oct-21,3,3,3,4,,,5,yes
Aegean Airlines,1,"""They canceled my flight""",2nd October 2021,TRUE,  They canceled my flight and did not notify me. I had to look the flight up myself to find out. Then they would only refund with a voucher that they won't send for 2 weeks and that expires in 12 months. So I will have already left Europe by the time I get it and will probably never be able to use it. I couldn't find a new flight within the same day because it was such short notice which screwed up plans for accommodation that I can't get refunded and so on.

Aegean Airlines,5,"""Aegean did not use to be like that""",26th September 2021,TRUE,"  Accurate departure and arrival, Excellent check in process via the mobile app, clean plane. The new baggage policy has turned Aegean into what i would consider a low-cost carrier. Booking a Flex ticket in order to carry your luggage along with a laptop bag or a purse onboard is unacceptable.  Aegean did not use to be like that. It was always a bit more expensive but the passenger was treated well, with good cabin service and with the ability to have a carry-on and a personal item onboard without having to pay anything extra.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heraklion to Thessaloniki,Sep-21,3,4,2,4,,,3,no
Aegean Airlines,2,"""I was 2 kilos over the limit""",14th September 2021,TRUE,"  My daughter bought this one way flight for me and paid Euro 140 with just cabin luggage. The ground staff representative asked me to change my flight to a flight that was leaving 7 hours later, without any consideration about the amount of money we had spent on this flight or what I was going to be doing for 7 hours at Corfu airport. My daughter had bought me this flight which was two times more expensive than the later one as I do not like to return home when it is dark. When I declined to change, she asked to weigh my cabin luggage. She then told me I was 2 kilos over the limit and I start unpacking my case, otherwise I would have to pay another Euro 35. I eventually left the check in area with my clothes over my arms and eventually repacked my case. While boarding, the same lady reprimanded me because I had repacked my case.

My Aegean flight came 30 mins late and I only had a 45 mins connection window to catch my flight to Thessaloniki with Olympic Air. No one made sure they waited for us, the boarding gate was across the airport so I was running for 15 mins. Had all my papers, covid pass and PFL checked before departure, yet they checked passports with another security check in control despite not leaving the airport.

Aegean Airlines,3,"""now all they have is a snack""",9th September 2021,TRUE,"  I think the theoretical boarding procedures they have in place for covid are really good. Fill the plane from back to front and avoid too many people being on top of each other. The problem is that they do not to execute the boarding procedures the way they say they will and that leads to a lot of confusion. They used to have in flight meals in Economy, now all they have is a snack.

Check-in at Larnaca was efficient and quick and all docs were checked with professionalism. Bags tagged all the way to Heathrow and boarding passes were given for both flights.

We recently came back from Athens Greece on 01.09 and we are very pleased with the crew and the service. I am missing the before COVID-19 period meals but the new kolatsio version is very good quality and tasty.

Aer Lingus,3,"""Worst lack of care""",21st July 2023,FALSE,"  We flew Aer Lingus last summer Seattle to Dublin to Edinburgh and then back Edinburg to Dublin to Seattle. Our plane left quite late from Seattle with no explanation and we ended up getting into Dublin several hours late missing our connecting flight. No one there to help, an hour bouncing around to different Aer Lingus staff in the arrival terminal w/o one person helping us. We finally ended up outside back at check-in in a long line of rebooking passengers who were told we wouldn¡¯t make the next Edinburgh flight as it was booked, last one out that day. The staff were unwilling to book us on Ryan Air which EU regulations say should happen as they had plenty of seats. A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it¡¯s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn¡¯t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife¡¯s suitcase and it didn¡¯t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it¡¯s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy. I¡¯ve been on hold with their customer service for hours, sent many inquiries, and tried to escalate this but no there cares about us. Worst lack of care for us we¡¯ve seen from an airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Dublin,Aug-22,4,4,3,1,3,,3,no
Aer Lingus,1,"""its service with a shrug""",18th July 2023,TRUE,"  Please beware that the entertainment system on the St MacDara aircraft Dublin to Orlando is not operational. What that means is that most of the seat screens are not working so even though you have paid a lot of money for your seat you had better have downloaded your own movies/music and games on your own equipment prior to the flight. Also the WIFI is not working. Aer Lingus state that it is a 'compatibility issue' but its actually that the plane is old and most of the equipment such as the controllers for the screens have been broken and not repaired. They are also serving freshly brewed iced coffee just before you land, even if you want hot coffee.

Aer Lingus,3,"""delayed by more than an hour""",18th July 2023,FALSE," Depart: delayed by more than an hour, no explanation. In flight: 90 minute flight, paid for extra leg room, not worth it, last off the plane. Shuttle from end of airport to terminal to get bags. Deplaning: They neglected to inform any of us (who waited for an hour) that they had to leave 40+ bags in Southampton, due to overweight on the plane.

Aer Lingus,2,"""inefficient with their check in""",15th July 2023,FALSE,"  They're so inefficient with their check in even airport security and marshalls were joking about it. The queue to get checked in was so long as the staff never pitched. The long queue disrupted other airlines from checking their customers through. I will avoid this airline. I booked British Airways, but they seem to codeshare with  Aer Lingus.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Belfast,Jul-23,3,3,,1,,,2,no
Aer Lingus,1,"""will never fly with them again""",14th July 2023,FALSE,"  Delays leaving Dublin caused us to miss our connection and they did nothing to help book our hotel room in Heathrow for the night. They dodged paying compensation and made it as difficult as possible to file for a reimbursement of out of pocket expenses. Eventually claimed they sent us a check but months on, no check and they refuse to respond to our case claim anymore. Their ¡°refund¡± call center doesn¡¯t actually exist so they can simply ignore your online claims. I suspect we will be left footing the bill at this stage.

Aer Lingus,1,"""they tell us flight closed""",10th July 2023,FALSE,"  We arrived over 2 hours before our flight was to depart from Dublin to Philadelphia and checked with ticket assistance when we saw a line in ticketing that was very long. The ticketing assistant told us to get in line. No mention of 75 minute flight closing time or that we should go to a ""special flight closing counter"" if the 75 minutes was close to expiring before we got to ticketing counter. We get to ticketing counter and they tell us flight closed, too late. Then when we go back to ticketing assistance counter, they blame us for ""not listening to the announcement"" that the Philadelphia flight was closing. We never heard such and announcement and asked the ticketing assistant why they did not tell us about all of this when we initially approached them and questioned them. They continued to blame us. Very poorly managed airline based on my experience, and the attitude of the employees who dealt with us was not a reflection of poor management.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Philadelphia,Jul-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Aer Lingus,2,"""staff are very rude and unprofessional""",1st July 2023,FALSE,  The staff at Dublin airport are very rude and unprofessional. I was 3 hours early for my flight from Dublin to New York. I needed help at the Dublin airport. I asked 5 different Aer Lingus staff for help and was told 5 different answers. I even spoke to a supervisor who was the worst of all the staff. In the end I missed my flight and had to reschedule. For Dublin to be the home hub for this airline they were the worst people to deal with. The hub in New York at JFK airport was must nicer and professional. The WIFI did not work in the plane and only half of the screens worked. The plane staff even made an announcement about the screens freezing up while watching a movie.

Aer Lingus,1,"""a sad excuse for an airline""",30th June 2023,FALSE,"  Aer Lingus is a sad excuse for an airline. Not a single of our four flights was on time. We were almost twelve hours late to Paris and had to sit in the Dublin airport all day. There were no employees available to discuss flight details or compensation for delays. The flights also either said they had Wi-Fi but didn¡¯t, or just said flat out they don¡¯t have Wi-Fi. Disastrous airline and I will never fly with them again.

Aer Lingus,1,"""Easily one of the worst airlines""",30th June 2023,TRUE,"  Easily one of the worst airlines I have traveled with. First, the connecting flight did not wait for us even if the origin flight arrived at Dublin on time. Ticket purchased at Aer Lingus, so they have the responsibility to await other connecting passengers as all other major airlines do. Second, and surprisingly the most irritating they never answer the phone of respond to emails. I waited for close to an hour on the phone and 1-1/2 hours waiting for an agent on Chat.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to Washington via Dublin,Aug-22,2,2,1,3,3,2,3,no
Aer Lingus,1,"""This airline is a joke""",29th June 2023,TRUE,"  Got on the plane and it is so old that there is no USB or outlets. We are burning up because they have no air flow, and we were informed the entertain doesn¡¯t work. It is a 7hr flight. This is outrageous for the price I paid for this ticket.

Aer Lingus,1,"""involuntarily denied boarding""",28th June 2023,FALSE,"  We booked our flight 7 months out and checked in 4 hours early. We were involuntarily denied boarding, causing us to lose 2 days of our vacation. They violated federal policy twice by not including a verbal or written reason as to why we were selected for IDB, and by not asking for volunteers to take a later flight in exchange for compensation. We were thankfully refunded the maximum amount for our flights ($1350 each). However, one of the checks bounced, causing us to incur an additional fee from the bank.

Aer Lingus,9,"""Very positive experience""",27th June 2023,TRUE,"  Cork to Dubrovnik return. Comfortable aircraft , Cork based crews very chatty and engaging. Legroom good.

Aer Lingus,1,"""customer service is non existent""",25th June 2023,FALSE, If you have to book with them and have no other option please consider buying air tags and if you are traveling with someone make sure you mix the clothing and belongings so that you don¡¯t end up having to buy an entire new closet for your trip. They lost our luggage and it¡¯s been 4 days now without our stuff and the customer service is non existent.

Aer Lingus,1,"""ashamed and embarrassed""",18th June 2023,TRUE," A lovely flight from Dublin to San Francisco - could not fault it. Things went rapidly downhill after that, and Aer Lingus complete lack of regard for paying customers became all to apparent. Our luggage went missing and Aer Lingus have been rude and unhelpful. As a customer I am so disappointed in the customer service provided by my national airline. As an Irish person I'm ashamed and embarrassed to think that other people may be subjected to this treatment. This is not the image I want my national airline to be portraying of Ireland and Irish people. We have a short six day holiday in San Diego; Day 1 is now gone because of Aer Lingus complete and total lack of regard and concern for paying customers. We paid €2808.50 for our flights (2 people) and it is disgusting to think that once they got our money they no longer care.

Aer Lingus,1,"""Lost luggage nightmare""",17th June 2023,FALSE," WORSE THAN SPIRIT AIRLINES! Lost luggage nightmare! This is easily the worst and least helpful airline I¡¯ve ever dealt with. I¡¯d even recommend Spirit Airlines over Aer Lingus. They lost our bags on our recent trip and have no desire to help us get them back. Their customer service is a joke and they are incapable of providing any answers to help us understand when we can expect the bags. Besides this nightmare we¡¯ve experienced, the planes are also small and uncomfortable.

Aer Lingus,7,"""would certainly use them again""",14th June 2023,TRUE," Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early.

We wanted to arrive early and see some of Dublin before the tour started so we booked an Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida to Dublin on the 17th of May. Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120). We were told that the incoming equipment had been delayed and that we would depart at 9:30 PM. The incoming aircraft arrived shortly after 9 PM followed by a fire truck! We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired. Imagine 300 people scrambling to get their checked luggage and make their way to the check in desk to get a hotel voucher (we found out that they booked the hotel rooms at 9:00 PM that night), madness. We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM. We arrived in Manchester at 7:20 AM on the 19th of May. Our connecting flight (Aer Lingus 3327) to Dublin did not leave till 5:45 PM that night. We arrived in Dublin at 6:40 PM. We arrived 33 hours late. We had paid for a hotel room in Dublin for the night of the 18 that we didn't get to use, and we missed the complete first day of our tour. We filed a claim with Aer Lingus for $ 600 each for me and my wife per EU rules. We also asked for $220 for the hotel room we had paid for, $174 for meals and $800 for the first day of the tour that we missed out on. They have offered us $147 in total compensation although they are responsible for our losses. Never again will I fly Aer Lingus or say a good word about them.

Aer Lingus,3,"""Aer Lingus the new Ryanair""",13th June 2023,FALSE,"  Had a connecting flight from Heathrow to Shannon. Flight was suddenly cancelled. I was told very rudely, you have 2 options, sit in the airport for 17 hours until tomorrow or move to Dublin. But you will then have to have a 3 hour bus journey to Shannon. What is so frustrating is this is a very regular occurrence, receive no apologies, then was made sit on the runway for 2+ hours without being able to purchase so much as a chocolate bar. I have been running from gate to gate like a headless chicken and have has no time to stop for some food. I'm starving. ""No we cannot give you anything to eat/buy until we are in the air"". Waited ages for flight then bus to take off, rushed again, no toilet on bus or time to run to shop. No where to charge phone to arrange a lift. 3 hour cold bus journey starved after that. Awful experience, will never fly Aer Lingus again. Obvious lies all the time, excuses for everything that were not even good ones. We got a free plastic glass of water from a 2 litre bottle and at no stage when people complained did anyone say 'Sorry'. Ryanair has become the new Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus the new Ryanair. Lots of extras costs to be as a result. Aer Lingus will regularly cancel Heathrow to Shannon on a Monday if the flight is not full to save them some $.

Aer Lingus,1,"""didn't deliver what I paid for"" ",13th June 2023,FALSE,"?I booked round-trip from Boston (BOS) to Amsterdam (AMS). Then I paid $500 extra to change to round-trip from Hartford (BDL) to Amsterdam (AMS) when Aer Lingus started flying out of BDL. Six hours before the flight, Aer Lingus cancelled BDL and had me fly out of BOS. I asked them to change the return flight to BOS since my car would be parked there. They said that would be another upcharge, which I refused. I requested a refund of the $500 since they didn't deliver what I paid for. They rejected the request. So on top of the $500, I had to buy an Amtrak ticket from Hartford to Boston to get my car and pay for two extra days of parking at BOS. This is unacceptable.

Aer Lingus,1,"""absence of an apology""",11th June 2023,TRUE,"  On May 6 flight , I was flying in Business Class from Dublin to Boston. I had expected an exceptional level of service, comfort, and attention to detail. Regrettably, my experience fell far short of these expectations. when I received my meal onboard. To my dismay, I discovered a disturbing bug in one of the dishes. This discovery was not only highly unappetizing but also raised serious concerns about the hygiene and quality control standards. Such a glaring oversight in food preparation is simply unacceptable. What adds insult to injury is the complete lack of acknowledgment or apology from any representative of the airline. I was astounded by the disregard for customer satisfaction and the absence of any effort to rectify the situation or offer an explanation. The absence of an apology or any form of follow-up after such a distressing incident further compounds my disappointment.",,Business,Business Class,Dublin to Boston,May-23,1,1,1,1,,,1,no
Aer Lingus,7,"""have concerns over the baggage fees""",4th June 2023,TRUE,  Aer Lingus ¨C Flight E1 178 on 4th June 2023. Dublin to London Heathrow. I shall start this review by firstly referring to the online booking experience. While the website is clear the added on fees such as seat selection and charges for baggage leave a bitter taste. I was livid to see that some passengers brought aboard bags larger than the one I paid to have in the hold based on the online information. Boarding was not efficient as there was no priority boarding for needy categories of passengers. Moreover the person checking & scanning the boarding pass did not even make eye contact and was using her mobile phone with one hand while scanning boarding passes with the other! This is unprofessional and something I have not seen before! Most of the cabin crew had a low profile with the exception of one very hard working lady who went above and beyond to assist and elderly couple. It was nice that some announcements were made in the Irish language as well as in English. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was efficient but again cabin crew other than the same hard working lady were invisible. The flight was operated by an A320 neo. This was ideal for such a short but very busy flight. The captain made clear announcements and safety was taken seriously. I would use Aer Lingus again but have concerns over the baggage fees.,A320 neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to London,Jun-23,5,2,,2,,,3,yes
Aer Lingus,1,"""this airline is horrible""",28th May 2023,TRUE,"  They didn¡¯t put our golf clubs on our flight on both legs to and from Edinburgh to Dublin. They lied and said they were on the flights when asked. We watched them unload them. We took photos of this. We had AirTags in our bags and were able to track. They constantly lied to us about them looking for them. They make you fill out a report and you never hear from them again. Through a third party we were able to have our clubs picked up, without the airline even knowing. The customer service staff is ignorant and unhelpful. Very unprofessional all the way the senior person who just couldn¡¯t be bothered and didn¡¯t care. There were 8 of us and this happened to 7 of 8. Worst flying experience. Everyone we spoke to in Edinburgh said this was a regular occurrence with this airline. If we didn¡¯t have the AirTags we would have been out our clubs.

I then had to wait an hour after arriving in Dublin to get another bus that wasn¡¯t even going to my home, it stopped 40 mins away so I had to arrange for someone to pick me up from there.

Aer Lingus,2,"""over 12 hours of delay""",27th May 2023,TRUE,"  Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Z¨¹rich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn¡¯t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn¡¯t have flights to Z¨¹rich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Z¨¹rich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn¡¯t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link. After filling out all the details meticulously, the form crashes with a server error. Wow.

Aer Lingus,1,"""our luggage has not been located""",23rd May 2023,FALSE," There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn¡¯t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can¡¯t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it¡¯s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let¡¯s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don¡¯t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Naples via Dublin,May-23,3,4,4,1,1,1,3,no

Although Aer Lingus are not always perfect, in my opinion they are one of the better and more reliable airlines today. They are reasonably quick to refund when there has been a problem, reasonably fair in their assessments of grievances and generally better at professional communication than most. There's definitely room for improvement but overall I am happy to spend money with them as I have seen they care about the quality of their services when it matters the most, i.e. when there has been a problem.",,Business,Premium Economy,Dublin to Geneva,May-23,3,4,4,4,3,3,4,yes
Aer Lingus,1,"""we are left to our own devices""",18th May 2023,TRUE," Welcome to post covid travel! I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying. I saw one mother patiently comforting her baby in stoic solitude, showing her character and instilling in her baby what true character is. This is what I saw and learned that night and what I saw from Aer Lingus? Not a damn thing!",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Dublin,May-23,3,1,1,1,,,4,no
Aer Lingus,3,"""shoddy customer service""",18th May 2023,TRUE,"  The security is amazing so quick it's almost worth the way you are treated on the flight, almost. Going from Dublin to LA we had a engine fault. Totally get it - it could happen to any good airline. We were trapped on the flight for one and a half hours before air conditioning could be turned on. Then we were freezing. After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told. Some one took pity on me and gave me one from business class. As a walked back to my seat clutching my bottle other travellers gasped with cracked lips ""where did you get that"" that was going to LA on way back exactly the same issues only I told the line to buy water before boarding. We landed in Dublin to something described as a breakfast burrito (it was hell on earth) and to add insult to injury we were not even offered a coffee! Shame on you Aer Lingus, shoddy shoddy customer service - in case anyone is wondering it was a ¡ê750 ticket. This is definitely what I would call a no frills air line.

Aer Lingus,3,"""I felt like I was in economy""",17th May 2023,TRUE," Never again. Paid megabucks for business class. No welcome on board drinks, e.g. champagne, orange etc offered. No drinks trolley coming round offering drinks throughout the flight, the only drink I was offered was with my meal. No duty free offered. No food came around until about one hour into the flight, it seemed as though they heated one meal at a time. Slow is an understatement. On our outward flight, of the 30 seats in business class, there were only 13 seats occupied, yet I still could not have the meal I wanted as they had run out? Food was bland and uninteresting. The staff seemed to be just doing as little as possible, not interested, not friendly at all to anyone really. Got a code for free wifi in Business Class, it did not work, so no free wifi. At JFK when we were boarding our flight, which was delayed by an hour and forty minutes, a ground crew member attempted to open the barrier to allow economy class ticket holders with buggy/prams to board before anyone else did, until another staff member told her that business class passengers should be boarding first. Apart from the roomy and comfortable seat, I felt like I was in economy.

But now this airline is a complete waste of money and time. The plane was dirty. The tables have not been cleaned, butter and coke was sticking on it. There was no pocket on the seat. But the biggest failure were the staff at Dublin airport. The ground crew was rude beyond imagination.  The woman at the gate yelled at me and others, ripped my boarding pass out of my hand and was really disrespectful. That was not what I was paying for. The other staff were fairly disinterested in service of any kind. Felt like they have a miserable job so anyone else should have to suffer. This was the last time for me traveling with Aer Lingus.

I flew with them last summer our flights were an absolute mess! They rearranged our seats without our permission, contacted them and were told it was fixed back took hours but it was fine. Ended up being rearranged again again without our permission again had to call in and were told it was fixed. When we arrived in Dublin for our transfer one of the family members was put on a completely different flight at a completely different time. The staff in Dublin were rude, they said there was nothing they could do at the gate and we'd have to leave the gate and go to the main desk at the office. After waiting for almost 2hrs because two other non-related flights got cancelled and they only had two people working the desk we were told there was nothing they could do and they don't know why one person was switched even though we had our email confirmations and they could see all the previous flights made. I followed up with their customer service team because this was ridiculous after months they offer a mediocre voucher for our experience. It is been 7 months and I've yet to see this voucher.

First off the online booking is a joke because they do not update their fares so by the time (5 minutes) you try to pay...you are unable to. Then you try to do it via the phone and all you get are non native English speaking ""service reps"", who can not understand you and you can't understand them (FYI I flew as a second office on a regional so I know my diction is good).

Each announcement was spoken too rapidly. As if there was a race on.! No sense of style. Just rush, rush, rush. Diction was very difficult to understand, particularly with male cabin crew on London /Shannon. Each word rushed into next. Just could not decipher what was being said.

I paid extra for legroom and window seating which I lost on two legs. When I asked about the seats they said send an email!!

Our flight was due to leave at 18.05, they waited until 18.25 to say the flight was cancelled and couldn¡¯t get us on another flight until the following day. We were then told to head back to baggage collection to collect our cases, and proceed to check-in to arrange the hotel. This would have been straightforward if they hadn¡¯t made us wait 2.5 hours to get our bags back. We then had to make our way to the hotel, most of that was guess work, only to find out our so called food voucher wasn¡¯t available for use in any of the hotel restaurants. They tried to palm us off with either fish or curry in a separate room and it wasn¡¯t being served until after 21:30. Travelling with children, this really isn¡¯t a fair deal. We were then informed we had been transferred onto the 06:30 flight the following morning, I mean come on, not eating until after 21:30 with children, then trying to sort cases etc and be up for 03:30 the following morning to make the flight, absolute joke! To make things even more hilarious, my friend was travelling on the Aer Lingus flight to Glasgow around the same time we were due to fly, they were 20 mins from landing and they turned back due to a technical fault.

Aer Lingus,6,"""a low-cost basic experience""",28th February 2023,TRUE,"  There was nothing wrong with the flight itself per-se - it took off and landed on time, generally calm. Terminal 2 security at Heathrow was calm, although amenities and shops quite poor - since Boots closed, you can't buy water anywhere for less than ¡ê2 which is extortionate. Boarding felt a bit early, but we didn't take off at departure time as it was quite slow - this was because there was only one gate agent checking in everyone including premium passengers and those requiring assistance, although automatic gates were used. Seats were above average comfortable for short-haul, on the way our was old-style so more padding and quite comfortable but on the way back was slimline but fine for an hours flight time - strangely the seat pocket in front had been sewn up so no where to store small belongings, which felt a tad low-cost despite the premium prices charged for this flight. Cabin-crew weren't especially warm and friendly and seemed rather unmotivated, they did pass through the cabin quickly offering the buy-on-board snacks and drinks but no menu was offered and it was almost like it was just a formality and seemed a bit surprised or put-out that some people actually wanted any like my neighbour in my seat. Buy-on-board products didn't look good quality from looking online, felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers. My biggest issue though is Aer Lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities, so they're not anywhere near cheap - yet it feels like a low-cost basic experience.
